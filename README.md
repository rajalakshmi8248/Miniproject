## LEGAL TEAM REVIEW AUTOMATION USING AI
AI-driven automation system for legal document review, incorporating Optical Character Recognition (OCR),and  Natural Language Processing (NLP).


## About
Legal document review has always been a long
manual process. A proper review is essential to ensure compliance
with regulations, investigate risks, and examine essential clauses
in contracts and agreements. The traditional method of review
is ineffective, prone to errors, and costly where a considerable
number of documents are being handled. This paper proposes
an AI-driven automation system for legal document review,
integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Language (ML) methods.
The system automates text extraction, clause identification, and
compliance checking/validating, producing efficiency and scalability in document review. The automation reduces operational
inefficiencies, minimizes risks, and allows legal professionals to
focus on more complex tasks. Results also indicate that the system
is highly accurate and rapid, and also that the system has great
potential to supply this market.

## Results and Impact

AI-driven automation system for legal document review,integrating Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).The system automates text extraction, clause identification, andcompliance checking/validating, producing efficiency and scalability in document review. The automation reduces operationalinefficiencies, minimizes risks, and allows legal professionals tofocus on more complex tasks. 

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
